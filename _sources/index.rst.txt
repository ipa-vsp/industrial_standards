ROS-Industrial Standards
============================

As the adoption of ROS 2 continues to grow in industrial automation, a structured approach is essential for supporting 
a wide range of hardware, including manipulators, mobile robots, cameras, and other peripherals. This guide aims to 
provide best practices and direction for creating ROS 2 drivers across these categories.
